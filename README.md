# Advent Calendar

This is an advent calendar made as a present for my gf. I am fully aware of the vulnerabilities that his project has. However as this is
not a huge project and the information is not sensitive I am not too worrried. 

In a more corporate jargon : "Security wasnt the scope of this project"
